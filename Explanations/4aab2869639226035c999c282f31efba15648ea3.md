        To address this incompatibility, there are 2 alternative options available in the new version of the dependency that can replace the incompatible method currently used in the client. You can consider substituting the existing method with one of the following options provided by the new version of the dependency:
        ``` java
        Storage newStorage(Config);
        ```
        ``` java
        Storage newStorage(Config);
