 * The metric is defined as follows: Given two points A and B, representing
 * circles centered at (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) with radii r1 and r2 respectively,
 * the distance is calculated as sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) + |r1 - r2|.
 * <p>

 * in a proximity search. To perform the search, use a point (x, y, R) where R
 * is greater than or equal to the maximum radius of a circle in the proximity
 * structure.
